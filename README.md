Gelbooru image downloader with tags

# NOTE OF API DISABILITY 
I did not notice anything about the abuse against the API.
If you wish to continue using this script to mass download images which skips ads, PLEASE donate to Gelbooru.com
They have to put up with server slow-downs due to the script and they do not meet their monthly server requirements reguarly it seems.
So please, either you have to put up with their shitty 3D ads or donate them so they can enable the API again.

I am pretty sure they will re-enable the API back once we do something about it and when they do, please do not abuse the script a lot.
The script is now intended to be used to mass download of a specific character/pose/specification just for drawing references or collecting artist images.

So please use it carefully and do not abuse Gelbooru.com and if you can, donate to their servers!

Thank you.
